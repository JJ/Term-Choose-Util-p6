NAME
====

Term::Choose::Util - CLI related functions.

DESCRIPTION
===========

This module provides some CLI related functions.

CONSTRUCTOR
===========

The constructor method `new` can be called with optional named arguments:

        my $new = Term::Choose::Util.new( :mouse(1), ... )

ROUTINES
========

Values in brackets are default values.

### Options valid for all routines

  * back

Set the string for the `back` menu entry.

Default: "<<".

  * clear_screen

If set to `1`, the screen is cleared before printing the choices.

If set to `2`, the "alternate screen" is used (control sequence `1049`).

[0],1,2.

  * confirm

Set the string for the `confirm` menu entry.

Default: "`OK`".

  * hide-cursor

The control sequence `25` is used to hide the cursor.

Values: 0,[1].

  * info

A string placed on top of of the output.

  * mouse

Set to `0` the mouse mode is disabled, set to `1` the mouse mode is enabled.

Values: [0],1.

  * prompt

If set, shows an additionally prompt line before the list of choices.

choose-a-dir
------------

        $chosen_directory = choose-a-dir( :layout(1), ... )

With `choose-a-dir` the user can browse through the directory tree (as far as the granted rights permit it) and choose a directory which is returned.

To move around in the directory tree:

- select a directory and press `Return` to enter in the selected directory.

- choose the "up"-menu-entry (`..`) to move upwards.

To return the current working-directory as the chosen directory choose "`OK`".

The "back"-menu-entry (ltlt) causes `choose-a-dir` to return nothing.

Following options can be set:

  * dir

Set the starting point directory. Defaults to the home directory (`$*HOME`).

  * enchanted

If set to 1, the default cursor position is on the "up" menu entry. If the directory name remains the same after an user input, the default cursor position changes to "back".

If set to 0, the default cursor position is on the "back" menu entry.

Values: 0,[1].

  * justify

Elements in columns are left justified if set to 0, right justified if set to 1 and centered if set to 2.

Values: [0],1,2.

  * layout

See the option *layout* in [Term::Choose](https://github.com/kuerbis/Term-Choose-p6)

Values: 0,[1],2.

  * order

If set to 1, the items are ordered vertically else they are ordered horizontally.

This option has no meaning if *layout* is set to 2.

Values: 0,[1].

  * show-hidden

If enabled, hidden directories are added to the available directories.

Values: 0,[1].

  * [Options valid for all routines](#Options valid for all routines)

choose-a-file
-------------

        $chosen_file = choose-a-file( :layout(1), ... )

Browse the directory tree like with `choose-a-dir`. Select "gt`F`" to get the files of the current directory. To return the chosen file select "`OK`".

See [choose-a-dir](#choose-a-dir) for the different options.

choose-dirs
-----------

        @chosen_directories = choose-dirs( :layout(1), ... )

`choose-dirs` is similar to `choose-a-dir` but it is possible to return multiple directories.

"`++`" adds the current directory to the list of chosen directories and "`OK`" returns the chosen list of directories.

The "back"-menu-entry (ltlt) removes the last added directory. If the list of chosen directories is empty, "ltlt" causes `choose-dirs` to return nothing.

`choose-dirs` uses the same option as `choose-a-dir`. The option *prompt* can be used to put empty lines between the header rows and the menu: an empty string (`''`) means no newline, a space (`' '`) one newline, a newline (`\n`) two newlines.

choose-a-number
---------------

        my $number = choose-a-number( 5, :name<Testnumber>, ... );

This function lets you choose/compose a number (unsigned integer) which is then returned.

The fist argument - "digits" - is an integer and determines the range of the available numbers. For example setting the first argument to 6 would offer a range from 0 to 999999. If not set, it defaults to `7`.

The available options:

  * name

The string put in front of the build number seen in the prompt line.

Default: empty string (`''`);

  * small-first

Put the small number ranges on top.

Values: [0],1.

  * thsd-sep

Sets the thousands separator.

Default: comma (`,`).

  * [Options valid for all routines](#Options valid for all routines)

choose-a-subset
---------------

        $subset = choose-a-subset( @available_items, :layout( 1 ), ... )

`choose-a-subset` lets you choose a subset from a list.

The subset is returned as an array.

The first argument is the list of choices.

Options:

  * index

If true, the made choices are returned as list-index positions.

  * justify

Elements in columns are left justified if set to 0, right justified if set to 1 and centered if set to 2.

Values: [0],1,2.

  * keep_chosen

If enabled, the chosen items are not removed from the available choices.

Values: [0],1.

  * layout

See the option *layout* in [Term::Choose](https://github.com/kuerbis/Term-Choose-p6).

Values: 0,1,[2].

  * mark

Expects as its value a list of indexes. Elements corresponding to these indexes are preselected when `choose-a-subset` is called.

  * name

The value of *name* is a string. It is placed in front of the subset-info-output.

  * order

If set to 1, the items are ordered vertically else they are ordered horizontally.

This option has no meaning if *layout* is set to 2.

Values: 0,[1].

  * prefix

*prefix* expects as its value a string. This string is put in front of the elements of the available list before printing. The chosen elements are returned without this *prefix*.

The default value is "`- `" if the *layout* is 2 else the default is the empty string (`''`).

  * sofar-begin

The value of *sofar-begin* is a string.

Subset-info-output: *sofar-begin* is placed between the *name* string and the chosen elements as soon as an element has been chosen.

Default: empty

  * sofar-separator

The value of *sofar-separator* is a string.

Subset-info-output: *sofar-separator* is placed between the chosen list elements.

Default: `,`

  * sofar-end

The value of *sofar-end* is a string.

Subset-info-output: as soon as elements have been chosen *sofar-end* if placed at the end of the chosen elements.

Default: empty

  * [Options valid for all routines](#Options valid for all routines)

settings-menu
-------------

        my @menu = (
            ( 'enable_logging', "- Enable logging", ( 'NO', 'YES' )   ),
            ( 'case_sensitive', "- Case sensitive", ( 'NO', 'YES' )   ),
            ( 'attempts',       "- Attempts"      , ( '1', '2', '3' ) )
        );

        my %config = (
            'enable_logging' => 0,
            'case_sensitive' => 1,
            'attempts'       => 2
        );

        settings-menu( @menu, %config, :1mouse, ... );

The first argument is a list of lists. Each of the lists have three elements:

    the option name

    the prompt string

    a list of the available values for the option

The second argument is a hash:

    the hash key is the option name

    the hash value (zero based index) sets the current value for the option.

This hash is edited in place: the changes made by the user are saved in this hash.

The options are passed as named arguments. See [Options valid for all routines](#Options valid for all routines).

When `settings-menu` is called, it displays for each list entry a row with the prompt string and the current value. It is possible to scroll through the rows. If a row is selected, the set and displayed value changes to the next. If the end of the list of the values is reached, it begins from the beginning of the list.
